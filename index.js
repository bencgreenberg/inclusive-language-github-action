  Hi there, ${user}! ðŸ‘‹
  \n\n
  We are happy to see you being active in our GitHub organization and want to encourage that activity!\n
  We are also mindful of cultivating an inclusive space and encourage you to avoid language that detracts from
  that inclusivity. Words such as "guys", "dumb" and "crazy" detract from the overall culture where everyone feels valued
  and appreciated in our community.\n
  Please review your recent contribution and revise for inclusivity.\n

  Thank you for helping us create a space where all want to contribute! ðŸ’™
